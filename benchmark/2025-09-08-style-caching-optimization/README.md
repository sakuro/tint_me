### 2. Benchmark Results (in chronological order)
- `01_baseline_results.txt` - Original performance before optimization
- `02_with_full_caching_results.txt` - Performance with both prefix and reset_code caching
- `03_prefix_only_caching_results.txt` - Performance with prefix caching only (no reset_code cache)
- `06_append_operator_results.txt` - Performance with << operator instead of string interpolation

### 3. Analysis Files

- `05_caching_approaches_comparison.txt` - Comparison between different caching strategies
- `07_string_concatenation_comparison.txt` - String interpolation vs << operator performance analysis

## Key Results Summary

### Final Implementation: Full Caching with String Interpolation
- **7-18x performance improvement** in style application
- **85-91% reduction** in object allocations
- **Minimal memory overhead** at creation time (6-18% increase)
- **Best overall trade-off** for typical usage patterns

### Primary Optimization Results (Included in PR)
- **Full caching** (prefix + reset_code): Best performance
- **Prefix-only caching**: 14-22% slower, minimal memory savings
- **No caching** (baseline): Significantly slower, high object allocations

### Additional Experiments (Reference Only)
- **String interpolation vs << operator**: String interpolation 13-47% faster
- **freeze optimization**: 2-4% slower (counter-productive)
- **Constant vs caching**: Caching 1% faster with better memory usage
- **nil? vs empty? check**: nil? optimization provides 0.4% improvement

## Implementation Details
- Cache `@prefix` and `@reset_code` in `initialize` method before `super`
- Simplified `call` method from ~35 lines to 3 lines of string concatenation
- Maintains identical API and immutability guarantees
- Transforms algorithm from O(n) to O(1) per call
